# Multiple-linear-regression-Ridge-and-Lasso-regressions


 :muscle:
Startup_Company Dataset :Dataset about 50 companies (startups) and extract from their profit-loss statements: how much in this given financial year a company spent for Research&Development, Administration and Marketing, which state it works in, and what the Profit is. 


Goal: 
As a data scientist, we are helping a company to assess where and into which companies it wants to invest to achieve its goal of maximizing profit. For that purpose, we have to create a model that would tell which types of companies it should invest in. Here Profit is the main criteria, a dependent variable. For example, our model should tell that a company should be interesting in startups that operate in New York, have very low Administration Spend and very high R&D Spend.Here we will use multiple linear regression, ridge and lasso regressions.
